# Spatial Statistics: Gaussian Process
## Definition and properties
The Gaussian process can be seen as an extension of multivariate Gaussian distribution from finite-dimensional case to infinite-dimensional case. It is a stochastic process or a random field (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space) such that the joint distribution of every finite collection of those random variables is Gaussian.

**Definition** (Gaussian process). Given a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ and an index set $\mathcal{D},$ a random field $\left\lbrace Z(s):\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\ |\ s\in\mathcal{D}\right\rbrace$ is called a Gaussian process if for every finite set of indices $\lbrace s_1,\cdots,s_n\rbrace$ in $\mathcal{D},$ the joint distribution of $\left(Z(s_1),\cdots,Z(s_n)\right)^\top$ is a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
