# Spatial Statistics: Gaussian Process
## Definition and properties
The Gaussian process can be seen as an extension of multivariate Gaussian distribution from finite-dimensional case to infinite-dimensional case. It is a stochastic process or random field (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space) such that the joint distribution of every finite collection of those random variables is Gaussian.

**Definition** (Gaussian process). Given a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$
