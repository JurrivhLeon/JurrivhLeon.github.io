# Spatial Statistics: Gaussian Process and Kriging

## Gaussian Process

## Kriging
Kriging is a method of interpolation based on Gaussian process, and is also known as Gaussian process regression (GPR). Georges Matheron established the theoretic basis of this spatial interpolation technique in 1960, and named it kriging (*French: krigeage*) to honor the pioneering work of Danie G. Krige in geostatistics.
