# Spatial Statistics: Gaussian Process and Kriging

## Gaussian Process

## Kriging
Kriging is a method of interpolation based on Gaussian process, and is also known as Gaussian process regression (GPR). Georges Matheron established the theoretic basis of this spatial interpolation technique in 1960, and named it kriging (*French: krigeage*) to honor the pioneering work of Danie G. Krige in geostatistics.

Given a random field $\lbrace Z(s): s\in\mathcal{D}\rbrace$ with its observation at location $s_1,\cdots,s_n$, the goal of kriging is to predict $Z(\cdot)$ at an arbitrary location $s\in\mathcal{D}.$

### Simple Kriging
In simple kriging, the mean of spatial field is known. Without loss of generality, set it to be zero.

Let $f:\mathrm{X}\to{\mathbb{R}}$ be the field of interest and $f\sim\mathcal{GP}\left(0,k(\cdot,\cdot)\right)$, we will interpolate the value of $f$ at an arbitrary location using its finite observations. Please note that $f$ is not a random field or a Gaussian process itself since it is deterministic. Instead, $f$ is a realization of the aforementioned Gaussian process. In the context of Bayesian regression, $\mathcal{GP}(0,k(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the prior distribution of $f$.

We first introduce some notations. Given locations $x_1,\cdots,x_N\in\mathcal{X}$, we use $\mathbf{K}$ to denote the covariance matrix of $\left(f(x_1),\cdots,f(x_N)\right)^\top,$ i.e., $\mathbf{K} = \lbrace k(x_i,x_j)\rbrace_{i,j=1}^N\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. We define $\mathbf{k}(\cdot):\mathcal{X}\to\mathbf{R}^N$ to be such that
<p>
  $$\mathbf{k}(x) = \left(k(x,x_1),\cdots,k(x,x_N)\right)^\top.$$
</p>

#### Overlapping Observations
In previous discussions, locations $x_1,\cdots,x_N$ are supposed to be distinct. In other words, we have only one observation for a unique location.

Now we suppose that we have $N$ observations at $n$ unique locations $\bar{x}_ 1,\cdots,\bar{x}_ n$ with $n < N.$ At location $\bar{x}_ j$, we have $a_ j$ observations $y_ {j,1},\cdots,y_ {j,a_ j},$ with $j=1,\cdots,n,\ a_1+\cdots+a_n = N$ and $\max_j a_j > 1$.

We denote
<p>
  $$(x_1,\cdots, x_N) = (\underbrace{\bar{x}_1,\cdots,\bar{x}_1}_{a_1},\ \underbrace{\bar{x}_2,\cdots,\bar{x}_2}_{a_2},\cdots,\underbrace{\bar{x}_n,\cdots,\bar{x}_n}_{a_n}) \in\mathcal{X}^N,$$
</p>
<p>
  $$Y = (y_{1,1},\cdots,y_{1,a_1},y_{2,1},\cdots,y_{2,a_2},\cdots,y_{n,1},\cdots,y_{n,a_n})\in\mathbb{R}^N,$$
</p>
<p>
  $$\bar{Y} = (\bar{y}_1,\cdots,\bar{y}_n)\in\mathbb{R}^n,\ \ \bar{y}_j = \frac{1}{a_j}\sum_{l=1}^{a_j}y_{j,a_j}.$$
</p>

Moreover, denote
<p>
  $$\bar{\mathbf{k}}(x) = \left(k(x,\bar{x}_1),\cdots,k(x,\bar{x}_n)\right)^\top\in\mathbb{R}^n,\ \ \bar{\mathbf{K}} = \lbrace k(\bar{x}_i,\bar{x}_j)\rbrace_{i,j=1}^n\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}.$$
</p>

Let $\mathbf{U}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ be a block diagonal matrix such that $\mathbf{U}=\mathrm{diag}\lbrace \mathbf{1}_ {a_ 1},\cdots,\mathbf{1}_ {a_ n}\rbrace$, where $\mathbf{1}_ {a_j}$ is an $a_j$-dimensional all-one vector, and let $\mathbf{A} = \mathrm{diag}\lbrace a_1,\cdots,a_n\rbrace.$ 

### Universal Kriging
In universal kriging, the mean of spatial field is unknown.
