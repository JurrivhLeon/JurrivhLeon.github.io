# Structural Causal Models (I): Formulation and Confounding Bias
My notes for reading *Causal Inference and Data Fusion in Econometrics*, by Paul Hünermund and Elias Bareinboim.

## Formulation
**Definition 1** (Structural causal model; Pearl, 2009). A structural causal model (SCM) is a 4-tuple $\mathcal{M}=\langle U,V,\mathcal{F},p\rangle$ where
+ $U$ is a set of exogenous variables that are determined by factors outside the model. 
+ $V = \lbrace V_1, \cdots , V_n\rbrace$ is a set of endogenous variables that are determined by factors in the model.
+ $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of functions $\lbrace f_1, \cdots , f_n\rbrace$ such that each $f_i$ is a mapping from  (the respective domains of) $U_i\cup Pa_i$ to $V_i,$ where $U_i\subseteq U$ is some subset of $U$ whose elements are related to the variation of $V_i,$ $Pa_i\subseteq V\backslash V_i$ includes the parents of $V_i$ in the underlying causal DAG, and entire set of $F$ forms a mapping from $U$ to $V.$ In other words, $f_i$ assigns a value to the corresponding $V_i\in V,\ v_i\gets f(u_i,pa_i).$
+ $p$ is a probability distribution defined over the domain of $U,$ which creates variation in the endogenous variables $V$.

Every SCM $\mathcal{M}$ defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{M}) = (V,E)$ (denoted as $\mathcal{G}$ for simplicity). Node in $\mathcal{G}$ correspond to endogenous variables in $V,$ and directed edges $E$ emit from the set of parent nodes $Pa_i$ towards $V_i.$ This causal DAG specifies the causal mechanism according to which the data are generated.

**Remark.** In a fully specfied SCM, any counterfactual quantity can be immediately constructed explicitly by variables from the underlying causal mechanism. These quantities are taken as axiomatic primitves in the potential outcome framework.

**Definition 2** (Intervention). Interventions in structural causal models are carried out by removing individual functions in $F$ from the model and fixing their left-hand side variables at some constant value. Mathematically, such an action is denoted by the operator $\mathrm{do}(\cdot).$

**Analytical Example.** Consider the directed acyclic graphs representing structural causal models.

The structural causal model $\mathcal{M}$ underlying in (a) can be formulated as
<p>
  $$\begin{align}
  Z &\gets f_Z(U_Z)\\
  X &\gets f_X(Z, U_X)\\
  Y &\gets f_Y(X,Z,U_Y).
  \end{align} \tag{1}$$
</p>

Naturally, we can explicitly write the counterfactual $Y_x$ as

$$Y_x \gets f_Y(x,Z,U_Y), \tag{2}$$

which would specify the value of $Y$ if $X$ had been $x$.

Now if we intervene on $X$ so that $X=x_0,$ then we can get another SCM $\mathcal{M}_{x_0}$ underlying in (b):
<p>
  $$\begin{align}
  Z &\gets f_Z(U_Z)\\
  X &\gets x_0\\
  Y &\gets f_Y(X,Z,U_Y).
  \end{align} \tag{3}$$
</p>

Furthermore, the post-intervention distribution of $Y$ can also be denoted in counterfactual notation as

$${p}(Y\in A\ |\ \mathrm{do}(X=x_0)) = {p}(Y_{x_0}\in A), \tag{4}$$

where $A$ is any measurable set in the domain of $Y.$

Given interventions $\mathrm{do}(X=x_0)$ (control) and $\mathrm{do}(X=x_1)$ (treatment), any difference between two probability distributions associated with $\mathcal{M}_ {x_0}$ and $\mathcal{M}_ {x_1}$ captures the variation of $Y$ resulted by the causal effect of $\Delta x = x_1-x_0.$

**Definition 3** (Observational identifiability). Let $Q(\mathcal{M})$ be any computable quantity of a model $\mathcal{M}$. Then $Q$ is identifiable from distribution $p(v)$ compatible with a causal DAG $\mathcal{G}$, if for any two (fully specified) model $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ that satisfy the assumptions of $\mathcal{G}$, we have

$$p_0(v) = p_1(v)\ \Rightarrow\ Q(\mathcal{M}_0)=Q(\mathcal{M}_1). \tag{5}$$

This definition states that for any two unobserved SCMs $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ with their induced distributions $p_0(v)$ and $p_1(v)$ coincided, then they provide the same answers to query $Q$. 

**Remark.** If $Q$ is identifiable, then it depends only on $p(v)$ and the assumptions in $\mathcal{G}$, and furthermore, can be uniquely expressed in terms of the observed distribution.

## Confounding Bias
**Notations.** Given a causal DAG $\mathcal{G}$ includes node set $X$. We use $\mathcal{G}_ {\underline{X}}$ to denote the graph obtained by removing all edges emitted by $X$ in $\mathcal{G}.$ We use $\mathcal{G}_ {\overline{X}}$ to denote the graph obtained by removing all edges pointed towards $X$ in $\mathcal{G}.$

### Backdoor criterion
**Definition 4** (Admissible Sets). Given a causal DAG $\mathcal{G}$ with treatment variable set $X$ and outcome variable set $Y$ assigned, a set $Z$ is called backdoor-admissible if it blocks every path between $X$ and $Y$ in graph $\mathcal{G}_{\underline{X}}.$

The following theorem states that the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ can be estimated by adjustment if a backdoor-admissible set exists.

**Theorem 1** (Backdoor adjustment criterion). If a set of variables $Z$ satisfies the backdoor criterion relative to $(X,Y),$ then the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ can be identified from observational data by adjustment formula:

$${p}(Y\in A\ |\ \mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \int {p}(Y\in A\ |\ X=x,Z=z)\mathrm{d}\mu(z),\tag{6}$$

here $\mu(z)$ is a probability measure over the domain of $Z$ induced by $\mathcal{G}$, In discrete case, we can write (6) as 

$${p}(Y\in A\ |\ \mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \sum_z {p}(Y\in A\ |\ X=x,Z=z)\cdot {p}(Z=z).\tag{7}$$

**Remark.** This conclusion has a counterfactual interpretation: For all $x$ in the domain of $X,$ the counterfactual $Y_x$ is conditionally independent of $X$ given $Z,$ i.e. $Y_x\perp X\ \vert\ Z.$

### Frontdoor criterion
**Definition 5** (Conditional frontdoor criterion). In causal DAG $\mathcal{G}$ set of variables $M$ is said to satisfy the conditional frontdoor criterion relative to a triplet $(X, Y, W)$ if: 
+ $M$ intercepts all directed paths from $X$ to $Y$;
+ There is no unblocked backdoor path from $X$ to $M$ (paths in $\mathcal{G}_{\underline{X}}$) given $W$;
+ All the backdoor paths from $M$ to $Y$ are blocked by $\lbrace X, W\rbrace$.

An example is given below.

<div align=center>
   <img src='https://github.com/JurrivhLeon/JurrivhLeon.github.io/raw/main/figs/causalDAG2.png' width='320'/>
</div>

**Theorem 2** (Conditional frontdoor adjustment). If a set $M$ satisfies the conditional frontdoor criterion related to $(X,Y,W),$ then the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ can be indentified by the frontdoor formula

$$\begin{align}{p}(Y\in A\ |\ \mathrm{do}(X=x)) &= \sum_w\sum_m {p}(M=m\ |\ X=x, w){p}(W=w)\\
&\times \sum_{x'}{p}(Y\in A\ |\ X=x',m,w){p}(X=x'|w)\end{align}\tag{8}$$

**Remark.** The frontdoor adjustment can be seen as a sequential application of the backdoor criterion.

### Symbolic engine: do-calculus
Let $X, Y, Z$ and $W$ be arbitrary disjoint sets of nodes in $\mathcal{G}$. We use $p$ to stand for probabilisty distribution. Do-calculus states the follwoing three rules:

**Rule 1** (Insertion/deletion of observations).
  <p>$$p(y\vert \mathrm{do}(x), z, w) = p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x),w)\ \ \ \textsf{if}\ Y\perp Z\vert X,W\ \ \textsf{in}\ {\mathcal{G}_{\overline{X}}};$$</p>
  
**Rule 2** (Action/observation exchange).
  <p>$$p(y\vert \mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(z), w) = p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x),z, w)\ \ \ \textsf{if}\ Y\perp Z\vert X,W\ \ \textsf{in}\ {\mathcal{G}_{\overline{X},\underline{Z}}};$$</p>

**Rule 3** (Insertion/deletion of actions).
  <p>$$p(y\vert \mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(z), w) = p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x), w)\ \ \ \textsf{if}\ Y\perp Z\vert X,W\ \ \textsf{in}\ {\mathcal{G}_{\overline{X},\overline{Z(W)}}},$$</p>
  
where $Z(W)$ denotes the set of $Z$-nodes that are not ancestors of any $W$-nodes in $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{X}}$.

To establish identifiability of a query $Q$, one needs to repeatedly apply the rules of do-calculus to $Q$ until the final expression no longer contains a do-operator.

**Remark.** 
+ Do-calculus was proved to be sound and complete for general queries of the form $Q = P(y\vert do(x), z)$ from a combination of observational and experimental data. Soundness means that an answer returned by do-calculus is correct. Completeness means that do-calculus is guaranteed to return a solution for the identification problem whenever such a solution exists.
+ By applying rule 2, we immediately obtain backdoor criterion: if $Z$ is a backdoor-admissable set for $(X,Y),$ then $Y\perp X\vert Z$ in $\mathcal{G}_{\underline{X}},$ $p(y\vert \mathrm{do}(x),z) = p(y\vert x,z).$

#### Warm-ip: Proof of frontdoor criterion
Let's revisit the causal DAG proposed above. Denote $W=\lbrace W_0,W_1,W_2\rbrace,$ set $M$ satisfies the conditional frontdoor criterion related to $(X,Y,W).$

<div align=center>
   <img src='https://github.com/JurrivhLeon/JurrivhLeon.github.io/raw/main/figs/causalDAG2.png' width='320'/>
</div>

Apply the law of total probability, we have
<p>
   $$p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),w) = \sum_m p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),m,w)p(m|\mathrm{do}(x), w).$$
</p>

By rule 2, because $Y\perp M\vert X, W$ in $\mathcal{G}_ {\overline{X},\underline{M}}$ and $M\perp X\vert W$ in $\mathcal{G}_ {\underline{X}}$ we have
<p>
   $$\begin{align} p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),m,w) &= p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(m),w),\\ p(m\vert \mathrm{do}(x), w) &= p(m\vert x,w).\end{align}$$
</p>

By rule 3, because $Y\perp X\vert M, W$ in $\mathcal{G}_ {\overline{M},\overline{X(W)}}$ and $X\perp M\vert W$ in $\mathcal{G}_ {\overline{M(W)}}$ we have
<p>
   $$\begin{align} p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(m),w) &= p(y|\mathrm{do}(m),w)\\
   &= \sum_{x'}p(y|\mathrm{do}(m),x',w)p(x'|\mathrm{do}(m), w)\\
   &= \sum_{x'}p(y|\mathrm{do}(m),x',w)p(x'| w). \end{align}$$
</p>

By rule 2, because $Y\perp M\vert X, W$ in $\mathcal{G}_ {\underline{M}}$, we have
<p>
   $$p(y|\mathrm{do}(m),x',w) = p(y|m,x',w)$$
</p>

then
<p>
   $$\begin{align}
   p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),w) &= \sum_m p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),m,w)p(m|\mathrm{do}(x), w)\\
   &= \sum_m p(m|x, w)\sum_{x'} p(y|x',m,w)p(x'|w),\\
   p(y|\mathrm{do}(x)) &= \sum_{w}p(y|\mathrm{do}(x),w)p(w)\\
   &= \sum_{w}\sum_m p(m|x,w)p(w)\sum_{x'} p(y|x',m,w)p(x'|w).
   \end{align}$$
</p>

### Surrogate Experiments
In practice, identification of causal queries based on observational data alone often remains an unattainable goal. Meanwhile, conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) for the treatment of interest might likewise be infeasible due to cost, ethical, or technical considerations. In such cases, a frequently applied strategy is to make use of surrogate experiments involving a third variable, which is only proximately linked to the treatment but more easily manipulable.

**Definition 6** ($Z$-identifibility; Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012). Let $X, Y, Z$ be disjoint sets of variables, and let $\mathcal{G}$ be the causal diagram. The causal effect of an action $\mathrm{do}(X=x)$ on $Y$ is said to be $z$-identifiable from $p$ in $\mathcal{G},$ if $p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x))$ is uniquely computable from $p(V)$ together with the interventional distributions $p(V\backslash Z'\vert\mathrm{do}(Z'))\ \forall Z'\subseteq Z,$ in any model that induces $\mathcal{G}.$

Then, the $z$-identification task can be solved in a similar fashion to the standard identification problem.

**Theorem 3** (Necessary and sufficient condition of $z$-identification; Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012) Let $X, Y, Z$ be disjoint sets of variables and $\mathcal{G}$ be the causal diagram. $Q=p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x))$ is $z$-identifiable from $p$ in $\mathcal{G}$ if the
expression $Q$ is reducible, using the rules of do-calculus, to an expression in which only elements of $Z$ may appear as interventional variables.

A weaker condition of $z$-identifibility, which is sufficient but not necessary, is given below.

**Theorem 4** (Sufficient condition of $z$-identification; Bareinboim and Pearl, 2012). $Q=p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x))$ is $z$-identifiable from $p$ in $\mathcal{G}$ if one of the following conditions hold:

(a) $Q$ is identifiable in $\mathcal{G},$ or

(b) There exists $Z' \subseteq Z$ such that the following conditions hold,

   + $X$ intercepts all directed paths from $Z'$ to $Y$ , and
   + $Q$ is identifiable in $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{Z'}}$.

**Remark.** The condition (b) states two things: 
+ $Z$ has no direct effect on $Y,$ and all directed paths from $Z$ to $Y$ are blocked by $X,$ hence $p(y\vert \mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(z) = p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x)).$
+ $X$ can be identified in the post-intervention DAG $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{Z}}$ by removing $\mathrm{do}(x)$ in the previous expression.

An illustrative example is given below.

<div align=center>

</div>

In the left causal DAG, $p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x))$ is unidentifiable. However, if we can manipulate on $Z$ to produce $\mathcal{G}_{\overline{Z}}$ in the right, then
<p>
   $$\begin{align}
   p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x)) &= p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(z))\\
   &= \sum_{w_1}\sum_{w_2} p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(x, z), w_1, w_2)p(w_1, w_2|\mathrm{do}(x),\mathrm{do}(z))\\
   &= \sum_{w_1}\sum_{w_2} p(y\vert\mathrm{do}(z), X=x, w_1, w_2)p(w_1, w_2).
   \end{align}$$
