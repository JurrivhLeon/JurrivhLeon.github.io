# Structural Causal Models
**Definition.** A structural causal model (SCM) is a 4-tuple $M=\langle U,V,F,P(u)\rangle$ where
+ $U$ is a set of exogenous variables that are determined by factors outside the model.
+ $V = \lbrace V_1, \cdots , V_n\rbrace$ is a set of endogenous variables that are determined by factors in the model.
+ $F$ is a set of functions $\lbrace f_1, \cdots , f_n\rbrace$ such that each $f_i$ is a mapping from  (the respective domains of) $U_i\cup PA_i$ to $V_i,$ where $U_i\subseteq U$ is some subset of $U$ whose elements are related to the variation of $V_i,$ $PA_i\subseteq V\backslash V_i$ includes the parents of $V_i$ in the underlying causal DAG, and entire set of $F$ forms a mapping from $U$ to $V.$
