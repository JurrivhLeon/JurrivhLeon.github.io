# Structural Causal Models
**Definition.** A structural causal model (SCM) is a 4-tuple $\mathcal{M}=\langle U,V,F,P(u)\rangle$ where
+ $U$ is a set of exogenous variables that are determined by factors outside the model.
+ $V = \lbrace V_1, \cdots , V_n\rbrace$ is a set of endogenous variables that are determined by factors in the model.
+ $F$ is a set of functions $\lbrace f_1, \cdots , f_n\rbrace$ such that each $f_i$ is a mapping from  (the respective domains of) $U_i\cup PA_i$ to $V_i,$ where $U_i\subseteq U$ is some subset of $U$ whose elements are related to the variation of $V_i,$ $PA_i\subseteq V\backslash V_i$ includes the parents of $V_i$ in the underlying causal DAG, and entire set of $F$ forms a mapping from $U$ to $V.$
+ $P(u)$ is a probability function defined over the domain of $U$.

Every SCM $\mathcal{M}$ defines a directed acyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{M}) = (V,E)$ (denoted as $\mathcal{G}$ for simplicity). Node in $\mathcal{G}$ correspond to endogenous variables in $V,$ and directed edges $E$ emit from the set of parent nodes $PA_i$ towards $V_i.$
