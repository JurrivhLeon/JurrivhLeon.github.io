# Structural Causal Models (II): Selection Bias and Transportability
## Selection Bias
Nonrandom sampling compromises the representativeness of the collected data for the underlying population, which can explain away the conclusions of both statistical and causal inference.
### Augmented Causal DAG
To capture the sample selection mechanism, a dichotomous variable $S$ is introduced to indicate whether a unit is part of the sample. Endogenous variables that affect the sampling probability will be connected to $S$ with directed edges. An example is given below.

After augmentation, we need to simultaneously control for confounding and selection bias in do-calculus. Not only is it necessary to transform interventional distributions
into do-free expressions, but the probabilities that make up these expressions now also need to be conditional on $S = 1$, because that is all the analyst is able to observe.


## Transportability
