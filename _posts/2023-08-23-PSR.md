# Proper Scoring Rules
## Convex Functions and Proper Scoring Rules
We concentrate on the problem of probabilistic forecasts on a non-empty set $\Omega.$ Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $\sigma#-algebra pf subsets of $\Omega,$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ be the convex class of probability measures on $(\Omega,\mathcal{A}).$
