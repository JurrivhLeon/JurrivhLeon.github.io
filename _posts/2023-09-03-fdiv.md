# $f$-Divergences
**Definition.** Let $P$ and $Q$ be two probability measures on a non-empty set $\mathcal{X}.$ Then for any convex function $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(1)=0$ and $f$ is strictly convex at $1.$ Suppose that $Q$ is absolutely continuous with respect to $P.$ Then the $f$-divergence of $Q$ with respect to $P$ is defined as
$$\begin{equation*}
D_f(Q\Vert P) := \int f(\frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}P})\mathrm{d}P(x).
\end{equation*}$$
