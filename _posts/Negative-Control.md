# Causal Inference: Negative Control
## Set-up
In the following discussion, we are interested about the causal effect of an action $A$ (or treatment, in biomedical literatures) on an outcome $Y$.
Define the action space to be $\mathcal{A}$ which can be discrete or continuous. Correspoondingly, define a measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{A}$, *e.g.* the counting measure if $\mathcal{A}$ is finite or Lebesgue measure if $\mathcal{A}$ is continuous.
